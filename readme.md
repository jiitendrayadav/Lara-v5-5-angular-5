![logo](image.png "Logo")

This is a simple Single Page Application starter for [Laravel 5.5.x](https://laravel.com) + [Angular 5](https://angular.io/) and [AdminLTE](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE).


## Installation

- Clone the repository
- then run `composer install` and follow Laravel [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5)
- and then run `npm install` inside resources/assets/src/my-app directory and follow [Angular CLI Documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you have any questions please use the Issues tab or submit a pull request. I tried to keep this as simple as possible just the basic form of a starter repository to be able to use Angular 5 with Laravel 5.5 as the backend.
